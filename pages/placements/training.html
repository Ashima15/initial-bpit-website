            <p>The Training & Placement Cell at BPIT is one of the strongest pillar of the institute. The T&P team constitutes dedicated professionals working continuously under the leadership of Dr. Babita G kataria & Dr. Gopal Krishan. <br> <br> 
            The era today is a competitive one, hence the Training and Placement Cell aims at the overall development of students. We strive hard to impart both theoretical and practical knowledge to make them more ambitious, goal oriented and industry ready. <br> <br>
            We expose the students to the demand of the industry at the very beginning of their journey with BPIT with an objective to develop a comprehensive skill set. <br> <br>
            Significance is laid on keeping the students abreast with the latest and upcoming technologies through Technical Trainings, Guest lectures & Industrial Visits. <br> <br>
            Training and Placement Cell initiated and introduced Personality Development as a part of the curriculum which focuses on making the students not only a better engineer but a better individual. <br> <br>
            The caliber of the students combined with the efforts of the placement cell has resulted in excellent placements in the last few years. <br> <br>
