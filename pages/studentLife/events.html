        <p>The dream begins with a teacher who believes in you, tugs you, pushes and leads you to next plateau and sometimes pokes you with a sharp stick called truth. Starting from Dronacharya and moving on to the great teachers in the history to the like of Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, teachers have guided their students to great success, embedded ethical values and molded them into responsible citizens of the country. Students celebrate teacher’s day on 5th September as a token of respect to their teachers. Students organize fun activities for their teachers followed by dance and music performances.</p>

        <p>Basant Panchmi is celebrated every year on the fifth day of Indian month of Magh (spring season, January to February). It is associated with Maa Saraswati, the goddess of learning, wisdom, knowledge, fine arts, refinement, science and technology. People worship the Goddess Saraswati to attain enlightenment through knowledge and to rid themselves of lethargy, sluggishness and ignorance. The colour yellow plays an important role in Basant Panchmi as it is related to the bloom of mustard flowers during this period. Moreover, Basant Panchmi holds a great significance for BPIT as the foundation stone of the institution was laid on this day. At BPIT, special prayers are offered in the morning to seek blessing of the Goddess Maa Saraswati.</p>
