            <p>The objective of the School of Business Administration is to create excellent managers out of ordinary boys and girls. We believe in the philosophy of Peter .F. Drucker; <br> <br>
            “No institution can possibly survive if it needs geniuses or supermen to manage it. It must be organized in such a way as to be able to get along under the leadership of average human beings.”</p>
